# Action-and-Effect-prediction

## [1] Overview
- Action and Effect-prediction using relevant annotations.
- Annotations: precondition, effect, super-class
- By using annotations relevant to action, we show that action and effect prediction can be improved.


## [2] Annotations
> Besided action labels provided by something-something V2 dataset, we labelled annotations (precondition, effect, super-class) relevant to action.
> Annotations: precondition, effect, super-class
>> Precondition: 60 classes
>> Effect: 88 classes
>> Super-class: 23 classes
>> Full labels of these annotations can be seen in:
